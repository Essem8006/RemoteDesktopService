# Screen Share Windows Desktop

![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/beta-blue.svg)

## Overview

This is my attempt of getting a working windows solution for my LAN screen sharing app. It uses Win32 API for the client side application with Winsock for TCP communication. All source code being under 'MyDesktopApp/HelloWindowsDesktop.cpp'.

## Building

Open 'MyDesktopApp.slnx' in visual studio and build as usual from there.
