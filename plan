That’s an excellent long-term project — ambitious but doable if you break it down systematically. Since you’ve got 2 years, you can afford to build it in phases, starting from simple proof-of-concepts and layering in features until you have something polished.

Here’s a recommended structure for your project timeline and architecture:



1. Understand the Scope & Core Requirements

A remote desktop system typically needs to handle:

Screen sharing (capturing the server screen, sending frames to client).

Input capture & injection (mouse/keyboard events from client → server).

Networking (communication between client & server over LAN).

Session management (authentication, connection lifecycle, error handling).

Performance optimizations (compression, frame diffing, latency handling).

You’re essentially combining real-time video streaming + remote input control.




2. Project Phases (Suggested Timeline)
Phase 1: Foundations (Months 1–4)

Learn the basics of:

Socket programming (TCP/UDP).

Screen capture APIs (depends on OS: Windows GDI, DirectX, X11, Wayland, macOS Quartz).

Input simulation APIs (Windows SendInput, Linux xdotool or uinput, macOS Quartz events).

Write a simple LAN messenger (client-server chat) to get comfortable with sockets.

Build a basic screen capture prototype (save screenshots at intervals).

Build a basic input injector prototype (simulate keyboard/mouse locally).

✅ Output: You can capture screen images and simulate inputs locally.














Phase 2: Minimum Viable Remote Desktop (Months 5–10)

Combine screen capture + socket transmission:

Server captures screen and sends frames.

Client receives frames and displays them.

Implement client → server input relay:

Client captures input events (mouse clicks, key presses).

Sends them to server, which injects them.

Start with raw images, even if slow.

✅ Output: A working, though inefficient, remote desktop over LAN.

Phase 3: Improve Performance (Months 11–16)

Add compression:

Use libraries like zlib or lz4 for fast compression.

Later, add video codecs (H.264 / VP8 via FFmpeg or GStreamer).

Implement delta updates (only send changed screen regions).

Use double buffering to smooth rendering on the client.

Consider multithreading (one thread for capture, one for encoding, one for network).

✅ Output: Smooth, low-latency remote desktop on LAN.

Phase 4: Robust Networking & Features (Months 17–22)

Add authentication (password, token).

Add session management (reconnect, multiple clients).

Add config options (frame rate, quality, resolution scaling).

Test across different OSes if you want cross-platform support.

✅ Output: Secure, configurable, cross-platform LAN remote desktop.

Phase 5: Polishing & Deployment (Months 23–24)

Create installers/packages for client & server.

Add UI/UX improvements:

Connection dialog (enter server IP).

Settings menu.

Document codebase & usage.

Test extensively on different hardware & network conditions.

✅ Output: A production-ready remote desktop software for LAN use.

3. Recommended Tech Stack

Language:

C++ (fast, low-level, but complex)

C# (great for Windows, WPF UI, easier API access)

Python (good for prototypes, not for final performance)

Rust (modern, safe, performant, but steeper learning curve)

Networking: TCP for reliability, UDP for streaming optimization.

Graphics/UI: Qt (cross-platform), WPF (Windows), or a lightweight GUI lib.

Compression/Encoding: FFmpeg (video), zlib/LZ4 (image deltas).

OS APIs: Depends on your target OS (Windows easiest to start).

4. Development Practices

Use Git for version control (start day one).

Break features into milestones (screen capture, input, networking).

Write small test tools before integrating.

Keep documentation updated (future you will thank you).

⚡My suggestion:

If your primary goal is learning, start with C# on Windows (easier APIs for capture & input).

If your goal is performance and cross-platform, go for C++ or Rust + FFmpeg.
